## Milestone 3

In this milestone, we performed the following actions:

- Make the BooksForm component stateful
    - The component should store the title and the book category in its own state
    - The component should implement the handleChange method which reacts to the user typing to input a name or to changes in the category select
    - Each change to the form should modify the component‚Äôs state
    - The component should implement handleSubmit which will save the new book in the Redux store and resets the component‚Äôs state

- Connect the REMOVE_BOOK action to the component
    - Add a new table column to the BooksList component. It should render the ‚ÄúRemove Book‚Äù button next to each book
    - Implement the handleRemoveBook method which accepts a book as an argument and removes it from the Redux store
